Various Deep Learning Applications using Tensorflow and Keras API

## 1.Convolution Neural Networks(CNN)

### Dataset 1: Fashion MNIST

#### About the Dataset:

- We'll need TensorFlow Datasets, an API that simplifies downloading and accessing datasets, and provides several sample datasets to work with.
- The Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28  Ã—  28 pixels), as seen here

- The labels are an array of integers, in the range [0, 9]. These correspond to the class of clothing the image represents:

#### Experiments Performed and their outcome:

- **Consider single hidden layer**

| Dense Layers  | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
|    512        |    86.75       |     86.18     |
|    10         |    79.99       |     85.02     |

- **Consider single hidden layer and without normalising images**

| Dense Layers  | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
|    128        |    85.98       |     87.51     |

- **Consider two hidden layer**

| Dense Layers  | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
|    128        |    93.30       |     89.74     |

- The above case with two hidden layers is an example of **overfitting**.
