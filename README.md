### Datasets : Fashion MNIST

- We'll need TensorFlow Datasets, an API that simplifies downloading and accessing datasets, and provides several sample datasets to work with.
- The Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28  Ã—  28 pixels), as seen here
